PC not updating correctly
inputs to iag are incorrect

Things to check:
pc_select = 1
pc_enable = 1
inc_select
make sure feeding it right immediate value

if pc_enable is 1, every clock cycle it will update the pc value
stage 3 is set to 1
stage 4 it's still 1 so it updates pc again
stage 5 it's still 1 so it updates the pc yet again

immediate value
not passing in the right 16 bits

Two different immediatie_output values
1.) D-Type immediate values are 7 bits long
2.) B-Type immediate values are 16 bits long
